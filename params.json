{"name":"Doom3.gpl","body":"### Doom 3 GPL source release\r\n\r\nThis is the Doom 3 GPL source code as it was released by id Software in late 2011. I prepared this source for release while I was at id, which is why this repository is present under my account. I am keeping it here as a reference due to the 400+ forks that were created out of it, but I am not doing any active development with it at this time. If you are looking for an active Doom 3 GPL source tree, have a look at @dhewg's fork https://github.com/dhewg/doom3.gpl, or at http://www.iodoom3.org/\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Doom 3 GPL source release","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
